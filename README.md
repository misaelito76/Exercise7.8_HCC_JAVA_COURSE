## Code structure
--> main method prompt 10 times asking for double values
--> values fill an array 
--> static method inside the main class is called from main method
--> average returned with a double value .
 program print average
## Approach used
The ten times prompt used is more user friendly than typing 10 double values in the same line, also a counter and a countdown help user to know how many values are added
